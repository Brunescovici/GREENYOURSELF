            <h3>Points</h3>
            <p>You earn points from different activities, such as participating in one of our current campaigns, inviting your friends to join our community, sharing our story to your followers on Instagram and Facebook, and even just using a reusable cup at the coffee shop instead of a one-time use one.</p>
            <h3>Ranks and rewards</h3>
            <p>Each activity gives a specific number of points, and some activities can be done once (such as signing up as a volunteer), or as many times as you like (participating in clean-up days). The more points you earn, the closer you get to the prize. You pass throught the ranks and become an important part of our community.</p>
