            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Danish Society for Nature Conservation is a century old non-governmental organization based in Denmark. Their goal is environmental protection, biodiversity, improved environmental legislations and better public access to nature parks.</p>
            <p>The Association for Nature Conservation created in 1911 and based in Copenhagen and their initial main goal was ensuring the public had greater access to beaches and forests. The Association grew larger and in a decade, it changed its name to the Danish Society for Nature Conservation, bringing it to a nationwide attention.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a variety of reasons why someone would want to volunteer. They want to help their community and make a difference in someone's life, or perhaps, they want to build upon their current skills and expand their knowledge.</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build a stronger community</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By volunteering you become a part of a larger team. You build your own idilic little community of volunteering with the same goals and aspirations. You strenghten your bond with the rest of society by being there for them at times of peril.</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find new friends</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteering helps you network, and find people with similar interests and hobbies. Like that, you are able to make lifelong friends along the way.</p>
                <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop your skills</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you want to develop your social and interpersonal skills, or get better at gardening and taking care of animals. Or maybe you just want to learn something completely new?
                <br><br>When you volunteer, you meet different obstacles and you learn how to resolve them.</p>
